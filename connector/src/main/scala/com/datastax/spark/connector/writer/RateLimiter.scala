/** A leaking bucket rate limiter.
  * It can be used to limit rate of anything,
  * but typically it is used to limit rate of data transfer.
  *
  * It starts with an empty bucket.
  * When packets arrive, they are added to the bucket.
  * The bucket has a constant size and is leaking at a constant rate.
  * If the bucket overflows, the thread is delayed by the
  * amount of time proportional to the amount of the overflow.
  *
  * This class is thread safe and lockless.
  *
  * @param rate maximum allowed long-term rate per 1000 units of time
  * @param bucketSize maximum acceptable "burst"
  * @param time source of time; typically 1 unit = 1 ms
  * @param sleep a function to call to slow down the calling thread;
  *              must use the same time units as `time`
